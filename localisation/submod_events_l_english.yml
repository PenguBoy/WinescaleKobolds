And as their leader requested an audience with the person who ruled these lands, and after long begging and pleading he was brought before Kylian VI.\nThe benevolent king listened to the plight of the small monster as he explained his people's desire for a place to settle free of discrimination and bloodshed. But the King was already hatching a plan.\nHe offered the Kobolds a place in his empire if they were able to claw it from the hands of the Winebayers, even offering to equip them with weapons and tools for the quest.\nThe Kobold accepted the offer but just as Kylian planned to stab the Kobolds in the back later, so knew the leader that such a knife to the spine was not unlikely.\n\n\nTravelling down the Bloodwine at night, the Kobolds took out severl borderguards until they stood at the gates of the Foxalley.\nAfter a week of heavy fighting in the streets and a series of Miscommunications between Rubenaire and the Winebay League, the Kobolds managed to to occupy a series of coastal cities.\n\n\nWith newfound pride about their color they name their clan the Winescale in honor of their new homeland."

This was no creature looking to steal their gold...\n...it was a Dragon!\nBrilliant purple scales reflected the candlelight onto the walls.\nThe Kobolds achieved what their brethren never could, they attracted a dragon to their hoard.

   drkscl.2.d:0 "The search for the Asra Hold was long and arduous, but after extensive digging, clearing caves, and losing many brave Kobolds to the grueling depths of the Serpentspine, we have finally seen the light at the end of the tunnel.\nWhen we opened it, we found that the hold had become more of a tomb. The stench of rot hung heavy in these halls, with the corpses of a few thousand orcs—the warband that had ambushed those who retrieved the Agate Gem—strewn across the hold's many chambers.\nSigns of infighting and cannibalism paint a grim picture of the last days these beasts endured, but it's not a fate any other race would shed a tear over.\nOnce the Hold was found, we quickly began widening the tunnels leading to it so it could once again be connected to the wider Dwarovrod.\nThe task we face now might be even more daunting. The hold is heavily damaged; the ceilings have either already caved in or are about to. Luckily, most of the core framework of the Hold is still intact, but rebuilding will be the task of a lifetime."

So, we face a choice: allow the Goblins to retain control with some autonomy or force them out entirely."
