And as their leader requested an audience with the person who ruled these lands, and after long begging and pleading he was brought before Kylian VI.\nThe benevolent king listened to the plight of the small monster as he explained his people's desire for a place to settle free of discrimination and bloodshed. But the King was already hatching a plan.\nHe offered the Kobolds a place in his empire if they were able to claw it from the hands of the Winebayers, even offering to equip them with weapons and tools for the quest.\nThe Kobold accepted the offer but just as Kylian planned to stab the Kobolds in the back later, so knew the leader that such a knife to the spine was not unlikely.\n\n\nTravelling down the Bloodwine at night, the Kobolds took out severl borderguards until they stood at the gates of the Foxalley.\nAfter a week of heavy fighting in the streets and a series of Miscommunications between Rubenaire and the Winebay League, the Kobolds managed to to occupy a series of coastal cities.\n\n\nWith newfound pride about their color they name their clan the Winescale in honor of their new homeland."
