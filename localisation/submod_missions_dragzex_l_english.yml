 DZX_short_diplomacy_title:0 "Short Diplomacy"
 DZX_short_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Gnomes of Giberd ensured that we Kobolds could settle in Esmaria, acting with no apparent motive beyond their good-heartedness and solidarity with fellow refugees.\n\nSince the Letter of 1467 and the subsequent donation of land to our people, a strong bond has formed between our two nations. Now, the time has come to take the next step and formalize these diplomatic ties."

 DZX_partnership_eye_level_title:0 "Partnership at Eye Level"
 DZX_partnership_eye_level_desc:0 "Bennon has been defeated, and we now stand on the brink of greatness. \n\nIndividually, the artificer guilds of Giberd and Dragzex are small and relatively powerless. However, by forging a partnership and merging our states in a union of equals, we can combine the strength of our guilds. Together, we could push back against the Gnommo with their extensive customer networks and resist the Magisterium's overwhelming influence. \n\nSmall folk together strong."

 DZX_home_hearth_is_desc:0 "The elves of Elvelenn are a peculiar group. Under the Duchy of Leslinpar, they were largely left to govern themselves. However, Anbennar is home to many scattered elven communities, and their unparalleled ability to efficiently administer even the most remote and disconnected lands could prove to be our saving grace. \n\nIf we entrust the various woodland regions to their control, we stand to gain not only their allegiance but also the benefits of their exceptional tax collection skills. This partnership could strengthen our hold over these territories and ensure smoother governance."

 DZX_carve_goat_title:0 "Carve the Goat"
 DZX_carve_goat_desc:0 "The Duchy of Bennon looms over both Giberd and our lands.\n\nWhile the former duke maintained a benevolent attitude toward us, his heir is far less welcoming, openly resenting the presence of these "pests" in his backyard. At the same time, his ambitions extend beyond mere disdain, as he openly covets the glass workshops and artificer secrets within Giberd.\n\nFaced with this looming threat, we may need to consider a preemptive strike and the partitioning of Bennon before it can gather the strength to crush us."

 DZX_mechanically_inclined_title:0 "Mechanically Inclined"
 DZX_mechanically_inclined_desc:0 "Kobolds possess a natural affinity for artificery, and our connection with the Gnomes has only strengthened this talent. \n\nNow that our nation is gradually taking shape, we can focus on establishing a powerful artificer guild—one capable of achieving remarkable results, even with the limited funding it is likely to receive."

 DZX_nascent_theocracy_title:0 "Nascent Theocracy"
 DZX_nascent_theocracy_desc:0 "Artificery within Drágzex faces the same challenges as its counterpart in Giberd: it is massively underfunded, and very few are willing to invest without a guaranteed return. \n\nThis is especially true with the Magisterium's heavy influence, which stifles innovation. However, we wouldn't be Kobolds if we didn't find a way to maximize the use of the little funds we have."

 DZX_heart_of_glass_title:0 "Heart of Glass"
 DZX_heart_of_glass_desc:0 "The Esmarian den of sin, the party capital of the Empire, and home to the wealthiest glassmakers far and wide, Esmarainé stands as a true gem of a city. \n\nBeyond its glamour, it serves as the political center of Esmaria. If we are to truly unite these lands and bring its many races together in equality, owning this city would grant legitimacy to our cause. \n\nMoreover, it would alleviate the immense pressure currently placed on the glassmakers of Giberd, creating opportunities for prosperity and stability to the Gnomes."

 DZX_path_esmaria_title:0 "The Path to a New Esmaria"
 DZX_path_esmaria_desc:0 "The Kingdom, and later Duchy, of Esmaria has endured nearly unending strife. From its foundation during the Dragonwake as a response to the establishment of the Wexonard Kingdom, to its dissolution and the chaotic succession crisis during the Lilac Wars, these lands have been in constant turmoil.\n\nSince then, Esmaria has remained divided, not only by its winding rivers but also by the differences between its races, lords, and conflicting ideals.\n\nIn this fractured state, the vision of a united and thriving Esmaria seems to exist only in the dreams of the most naive or ambitious nobles.\nPerhaps monarchical ideals were never truly the path meant for the Esmarian people. Instead, we may find our destiny in forging a new Republic, a nation built on equality, prosperity, and, of course, grand celebrations!"

Even with the generous aid and tools provided by the Elves and Dwarves, the task ahead remains daunting. \n\nWe must gather the brightest minds among our people and determine the steps necessary to forge a true nation from these scattered beginnings."

 DZX_proper_prospecting_title:0 "Proper Prospecting"
 DZX_proper_prospecting_desc:0 "Kobold mining efforts in the Havoral Mountains have been progressing well, but we lack the knowledge the Dwarves once had to properly locate the larger veins and identify which parts of the mountain are best suited for mining. \n\nWe should establish a serious prospecting company and hire a few Dwarves to assist us with this task. Perhaps, we should also consider "taking a look" at the other side of the divide."

Under Isobel’s guidance, the city flourished into a renowned center of learning and education. \n\nIf we take control of Gabmórionn, it is imperative to preserve Isobel’s legacy—ensuring that her vision of educating even society's most marginalized endures. Her name must continue to shine as a beacon of knowledge and enlightenment."

They often supplied boats with stolen liquor from Ibevar and were among the few daring enough to accept Dwarven drinking challenges.\n\nAs a result, the Kobolds of Drágzex soon became a natural and cherished part of Esmarian society."

Though their electorate would pass to us, we will ensure that they retain the right to vote on imperial matters, and we will not strip that right from their hands."

 DZX_gutter_crown_title:0 "Crown to the Gutter"

Despite this, their control over the mouth of the Esmar River allows them to wield immense influence over these lands. \n\nMost troubling of all are the tolls they impose on goods shipped down the river, effectively making all of Esmaria tributaries to their whims. This cannot continue. The flow of goods must be freed from the grasp of these outsiders once and for all!"
